In other words, you'd need a payoff ratio north of 1.5 just to breakeven at a 40% win rate, yet your revenge payoff is only 1.36\u00d7 (compared with 1.23\u00d7 overall). Bottom line: taking trades in the heat of frustration is costing you real money and eroding your edge\u2014best to pause and stick to your plan rather than chase losses.",
