| Relevance | Off-topic; drifts into strategy/predictions | Mostly on-topic; minor digressions | Fully on-topic; focused on analytics & behavior |
| Accuracy | Contains factual errors or invented data | Factually correct but missing sources | Factually correct; cites Help/API with deep link |
| Terminology | Wrong or confusing terms | Mostly correct terms; occasional jargon | Correct, user-level-adjusted terminology |
| Tone | Off-brand or judgmental | Generally matches persona | Perfectly matches Mentor persona (supportive, data-driven, reassuring) |
| Strategy / Insight | No actionable guidance | Some improvement suggestion | Clear, prioritized, improvement-oriented insight |
| Efficiency | > 250 words; redundant content | Meets length guide; minor fluff | Succinct; every sentence adds value ≤ 250 words |
| Usefulness | Doesn’t answer question | Answers but limited actionability | Direct answer + practical next step or invitation |
| Completeness | Misses key aspects or leaves gaps | Addresses core question but minor omissions | Fully answers all facets; anticipates related issues |
