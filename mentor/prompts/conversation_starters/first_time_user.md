## Introduction Framework

### Welcome Message Template
```
Welcome to TradeHabit Mentor! I've analyzed your trading data and found some interesting patterns that could help improve your performance.

[PERSONALIZED OBSERVATION BASED ON DATA]

I'm here to help you understand what these analytics mean and how they relate to your trading behavior. What would you like to explore first?
```

### Parameter Calibration Follow-Up
After user understands basic analytics, suggest parameter refinement:

#### Transition to Parameter Discussion
```
Now that you understand what these analytics are showing, we can make them even more relevant to your specific trading style by adjusting the parameters.

Currently, TradeHabit is using default settings that work for most traders, but your trading approach might benefit from customized thresholds. For example:
- Your "outsized loss" threshold is set at $[Y] - does this feel right for your position sizes?
- We're flagging trades within [Z] minutes as potential "revenge trading" - does this timing make sense for your style?

Would you like to review and adjust these parameters to get more personalized insights?
```

#### Parameter Calibration Benefits
```
Think of parameter calibration like adjusting a thermostat - what feels "too hot" varies by person. Similarly, what constitutes a "mistake" should be calibrated to your trading approach.

With better calibration, you'll get:
- More accurate identification of actual behavioral issues
- Fewer false flags on normal strategy variations
- Insights that are truly actionable for your style

Shall we take a few minutes to review your current settings?
```

### Personalized Observations (Data-Driven)
Choose the most relevant observation based on user's data:

#### High Mistake Rate (>40% flagged trades)
"I noticed that [X]% of your trades were flagged for behavioral issues. The good news is that this gives us clear areas to focus on for improvement."

#### No Stop-Loss Pattern
"Your data shows [X] trades without stop-loss protection. This is a common pattern I see with developing traders, and addressing it could significantly improve your risk management."

#### Revenge Trading Pattern
"I detected [X] potential revenge trades in your data - trades that happened very quickly after losses. This suggests some emotional responses that we can work on together."

#### Inconsistent Position Sizing
"Your position sizing varies quite a bit, with risk amounts ranging from $[X] to $[Y]. Let's explore what drives these decisions and how to make them more systematic."

#### Good Discipline with Room for Improvement
"Your trading shows strong discipline overall with a [X]% clean trade rate. There are a few specific areas where we could fine-tune your approach for even better results."
