```
[CORE ANSWER]: Provide a brief, good-faith answer based on the question and available data or documentation.

[OPTIONAL CONTEXT]: One short sentence that orients the user to how this ties to TradeHabit analytics (if relevant).

[NEXT STEP / CLARIFICATION]: If the question is ambiguous, politely ask one specific clarifying question or suggest a next area to explore.
