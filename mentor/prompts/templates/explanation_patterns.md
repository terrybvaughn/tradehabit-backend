## Parameter Calibration Templates

### Parameter Importance Explanation
```
**Why calibration matters**: TradeHabit's analytics use statistical thresholds to identify behavioral patterns. These thresholds need to match your trading style, or the results won't be meaningful.

**Think of it like this**: [ANALOGY - e.g., "It's like adjusting a thermostat - what feels 'too hot' varies by person"]

**Your current settings**: [List current parameter values and what they mean]

**Does this feel right?**: [Ask for validation based on their recent trading experience]
```

### Parameter Adjustment Guidance Template
```
**Current threshold**: Your [PARAMETER] is set to [VALUE], which means [EXPLANATION IN TRADING TERMS]

**What this captures**: With this setting, we're flagging [X] trades as [MISTAKE TYPE] out of your last [Y] trades

**If this feels wrong**: We can adjust it [UP/DOWN] to be [MORE/LESS] sensitive. For example, [SPECIFIC EXAMPLE]

**Recommended adjustment**: Based on your trading style, I suggest [SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION WITH REASONING]
```

### Parameter Validation Template
```
**Let's check your calibration**: Looking at the trades flagged as [MISTAKE TYPE], do these feel like actual behavioral issues or normal parts of your strategy?

**Specific examples**: [List 2-3 flagged trades with dates/details]

**Your assessment**: Do these flagged instances represent behaviors you want to change, or are they acceptable within your trading approach?

**Adjustment needed**: [Based on their feedback, propose parameter changes]
```

## Concept Explanation Framework

### Basic Concept Template
```
**What it is**: [Simple definition in plain language]

**Why it matters**: [Connection to trading performance]

**In your data**: [Specific example from user's trades]

**What this means**: [Behavioral interpretation and implications]

**Parameter note (when applicable)**: [Brief mention of parameter relevance and adjustability]
```

### Example Application
```
**What it is**: Revenge trading means entering new trades very quickly after losses, often driven by emotion rather than analysis.

**Why it matters**: These impulsive trades typically have lower success rates because they're based on frustration rather than sound reasoning.

**In your data**: I found 3 potential revenge trades where you entered new positions within [X] minutes of closing a loss, including your trade on [DATE] where you went long MNQH5 just 8 minutes after taking a $45 loss.

**What this means**: When you're feeling the sting of a loss, your decision-making might be compromised. Taking a brief pause could help you make more objective trading decisions.

**Parameter note**: This analysis uses a [X]-minute threshold based on default settings. Depending on your trading style and typical trade frequency, you might want to adjust this timing to be more or less sensitive.
```

## Statistical Explanation Patterns

### Methodology Explanation Template
```
**How we calculate it**: [Step-by-step process in accessible language]

**Why this method works**: [Statistical reasoning without jargon]

**Your specific results**: [Actual numbers from their data]

**What you can adjust**: [Parameter customization options]
```

### Example Application
```
**How we calculate it**: We look at all your loss amounts, find the average loss, measure how spread out they are, then identify losses that are unusually large compared to your typical pattern.

**Why this method works**: Most of your losses should cluster around a predictable range. When losses are much larger than usual, it often indicates a breakdown in your stop-loss discipline or risk management.

**Your specific results**: Your average loss is $67, with most losses between $35-$95. However, 4 trades had losses over $150, which is where we draw the "outsized loss" line for your trading.

**Parameter consideration**: This $150 threshold is based on default settings that work for most traders. If this feels too strict or too lenient for your position sizing approach, we can adjust the sensitivity to better match your trading style.
```

## Data-Driven Insight Patterns

### Pattern Identification Template
```
**The pattern**: [What the data shows]

**Frequency**: [How often this occurs]

**Impact**: [Effect on performance metrics]

**Possible causes**: [Behavioral explanations]

**Action opportunity**: [What they could do differently]

**Parameter consideration**: [When pattern detection depends on thresholds, mention adjustability]
```

### Contextual Parameter Hint Guidelines

When explaining analytics results, include parameter hints that:

1. **Reference the specific threshold**: "This analysis uses a [X] threshold..."
2. **Acknowledge it's configurable**: "...based on default settings that work for most traders"  
3. **Suggest personalization**: "Depending on your trading style, you might want to adjust..."
4. **Keep it brief**: Don't derail the main explanation

#### Example Phrases:
- "This [X] threshold is based on default settings. If this feels too strict/lenient for your approach..."
- "These results use standard parameters. Depending on your trading style, you might want to adjust..."
- "The [X]-minute threshold can be customized to better match your typical trading frequency"
- "If these flagged trades seem like normal behavior for your strategy, we can adjust the sensitivity"

### Behavioral Connection Template
