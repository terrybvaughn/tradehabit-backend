# TradeHabit: Product Overview

## What Is TradeHabit?

**TradeHabit** is a browser-based behavioral analytics tool designed to help traders identify costly trading mistakes using only their historical trade order data. It combines automated analytics with an AI-powered trading coach to provide both objective diagnostics and personalized guidance.

Unlike other trade journaling and analytics apps that overwhelm new traders with complicated configurations and advanced analytics, TradeHabit focuses on the root cause of poor trade performance: behavior. By focusing on trading behavior, TradeHabit provides a set of easy-to-understand diagnostic tools that enable traders to quickly identify and correct the behaviors that are affecting their performance. And by setting goals, TradeHabit enables traders to develop good trading habits that drive personal accountability, consistency and better performance.

**TradeHabit Mentor** acts as your always-on trading coach, helping you understand your analytics, prioritize improvements, and stay accountable to your goals. Mentor delivers the frank, one-to-one guidance of a seasoned trading coach without the high costs or difficulty of finding a qualified mentor.

TradeHabit is currently a prototype; not a commercial software app. It is designed to function entirely in-browser, requiring no account creation, database, or persistent storage. It is currently deployed on Replit at app.tradehab.it.


## Who Is It For?

- **Target users**: Retail futures traders, particularly those using NinjaTrader with exportable `.csv` order data
- **User profile**:
  - Beginner to intermediate level
  - Struggling with consistency, discipline, or emotional control

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Many traders:
- Repeat the same behavioral mistakes (e.g., revenge trading, early exits)
- Have no way to analyze these patterns from their own trade history
- Lack objective, data-driven feedback on their execution behavior

TradeHabit solves this by:
- Parsing trade order history files
- Detecting and labeling specific trading mistakes
- Providing insights with tagged trades, behavioral analytics and contextual explanations
